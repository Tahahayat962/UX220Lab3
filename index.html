        <header><h1>Last Favorite Movie</h1></header>
        <p>My favorite movie that I watched was Spider-Man: No Way Home in a movie theatre a couple of years ago, I don't actually remember much about the movie but it is the only movie I have seen in the last 3 years. </p>
        <p>I went to go see the movie with my close friends while visiting home and it was a moment I remember fondly and cherish, I mainly watched the movie because my friend got me and my other friends </p>
        <p>discounted tickets as well as something to do with my friends, as far as the movie goes I remember enjoying the acting, humor and suspense and having an overall great time that night.</p>
